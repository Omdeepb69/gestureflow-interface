# GestureFlow Interface

Control applications or simple hardware using intuitive hand gestures recognized in real-time via webcam, bringing advanced human-computer interaction to your desktop. This project uses computer vision techniques to track hand movements and recognize predefined gestures, mapping them to configurable actions.

## Features

-   Real-time hand tracking and landmark detection using MediaPipe.
-   Classification of predefined gestures (e.g., open palm, fist, thumbs up, pointing) based on landmark geometry.
-   Mapping recognized gestures to specific actions (e.g., controlling mouse pointer, keyboard shortcuts, toggling an LED via Arduino/Raspberry Pi).
-   Visual feedback overlay on the camera stream showing detected landmarks and the currently recognized gesture.
-   Configuration file (e.g., JSON or YAML) to easily customize gesture-to-action mappings.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/GestureFlow-Interface.git
    cd GestureFlow-Interface
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with the actual username or organization)*

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    A `requirements.txt` file should be included in the repository.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Key dependencies include:
    -   `opencv-python`
    -   `mediapipe`
    -   `numpy`

    Optional dependencies (install manually if needed for specific features):
    -   `pyautogui` (for OS-level mouse/keyboard control)
        ```bash
        pip install pyautogui
        ```
    -   `pyserial` (for Arduino/serial hardware communication)
        ```bash
        pip install pyserial
        ```

## Project Structure

A typical project structure might look like this:

```
GestureFlow-Interface/
├── main.py                 # Main script to run the application
├── gesture_recognizer.py   # Module for hand tracking and gesture classification
├── action_mapper.py        # Module for mapping gestures to actions
├── config.yaml             # Configuration file for settings and gesture mappings (or config.json)
├── utils/                    # Utility functions (if needed)
├── requirements.txt        # Project dependencies
└── README.md               # This file
```

-   `main.py`: Entry point of the application. Initializes the camera, loads configuration, and runs the main processing loop.
-   `gesture_recognizer.py`: Contains the core logic for detecting hand landmarks using MediaPipe and classifying gestures based on geometric rules.
-   `action_mapper.py`: Translates recognized gestures into specific commands (e.g., simulating key presses, controlling mouse, sending serial data).
-   `config.yaml` (or `.json`): Defines gesture recognition parameters and maps recognized gestures to specific action strings or commands.
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists Python packages required for the project.

## Usage

1.  **Configure Mappings (Optional but Recommended):**
    -   Edit the `config.yaml` (or `config.json`) file to define the gestures you want to recognize and the actions they should trigger.
    -   Example structure within `config.yaml`:
        ```yaml
        # Settings for MediaPipe Hand Landmarker
        hand_landmarker_options:
          num_hands: 1
          min_hand_detection_confidence: 0.5
          min_hand_presence_confidence: 0.5
          min_tracking_confidence: 0.5

        # Gesture definitions based on landmark analysis logic
        gestures:
          FIST:
            # Rules defining a fist gesture (implementation-specific)
            # Example: check distances between fingertips and palm center
          OPEN_PALM:
            # Rules defining an open palm gesture
            # Example: check if fingers are extended
          POINTING_INDEX:
            # Rules for pointing gesture

        # Mapping gestures to actions
        actions:
          FIST: "key:ctrl+alt+t"       # Example: Trigger keyboard shortcut
          OPEN_PALM: "mouse:move_relative(0, -10)" # Example: Move mouse up
          POINTING_INDEX: "mouse:click"   # Example: Simulate mouse click
          # THUMBS_UP: "serial:LED_ON" # Example: Send command via serial
        ```
    *(Note: The specific rules within `gestures` and the format of `actions` depend on the implementation in `gesture_recognizer.py` and `action_mapper.py`.)*

2.  **Run the Application:**
    Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible. Execute the main script from the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    -   The application will launch, activating the webcam.
    -   A window should appear displaying the camera feed. Detected hand landmarks and the currently recognized gesture (if any) will be overlaid on the video.
    -   Perform the configured hand gestures within the camera's view to trigger the associated actions.
    -   Press 'q' (or another designated key, as implemented) while the display window is active to quit the application.

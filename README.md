# GestureFlow Interface

Control applications or simple hardware using intuitive hand gestures recognized in real-time via webcam, bringing advanced human-computer interaction to your desktop. This project uses computer vision techniques to track hand movements and recognize predefined gestures, mapping them to configurable actions.

## Features

-   Real-time hand tracking and landmark detection using MediaPipe.
-   Classification of predefined gestures (e.g., open palm, fist, thumbs up, pointing) based on landmark geometry.
-   Mapping recognized gestures to specific actions (e.g., controlling mouse pointer, keyboard shortcuts, toggling an LED via Arduino/Raspberry Pi).
-   Visual feedback overlay on the camera stream showing detected landmarks and the currently recognized gesture.
-   Configuration file (e.g., JSON or YAML) to easily customize gesture-to-action mappings.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Omdeepb69/GestureFlow-Interface.git
    cd GestureFlow-Interface
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with the actual username or organization)*

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
   create it if u a bitch
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    hmmm in the requirement.txt
        ```

## Project Structure

A typical project structure might look like this:

```
GestureFlow-Interface/
├── main.py                 # Main script to run the application
├── gesture_recognizer.py   # Module for hand tracking and gesture classification
├── action_mapper.py        # Module for mapping gestures to actions
├── config.yaml             # Configuration file for settings and gesture mappings (or config.json)
├── utils/                    # Utility functions (if needed)
├── requirements.txt        # Project dependencies
└── README.md               # This file
```

-   `main.py`: Entry point of the application. Initializes the camera, loads configuration, and runs the main processing loop.
-   `gesture_recognizer.py`: Contains the core logic for detecting hand landmarks using MediaPipe and classifying gestures based on geometric rules.
-   `action_mapper.py`: Translates recognized gestures into specific commands (e.g., simulating key presses, controlling mouse, sending serial data).
-   `config.yaml` (or `.json`): Defines gesture recognition parameters and maps recognized gestures to specific action strings or commands.
-   `requirements.txt`: Lists Python packages required for the project.
